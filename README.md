# Quick-Resize-Tool-
Mass Resizing of Images at once. Made with the power of Python.



## To Start, All you have to do is place this file in a location where you have all the screenshots for the resize. 
## Next, Navagate to location where this file is located in cmd. 
## Then run py Resize.py and wait a few seconds and boom. All the screenshots have been resized and added to a folder. 
## I hope this makes mass resizing quicker!!!
## Feel free to edit and rework the code for better use

## Delete All Created Folders from this proccess to start over. 

## Ex. This tool was use for me to create screenshots for multiple resolutions and seperate them into a folder for later use
